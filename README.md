Hello

By picking up and plugging in this USB you have become a test subject for the GVSU Hackers Analyzing Threats club

Do not panic, this is not a virus and will not harm your computer in any way.

In the future do not plug in USB drives you find on the ground, they may not be as polite as this one ;)

Please return this to any of the IT Service desks located around campus (LIB, MAN 201, CAC near the vending machines, ASH 1141)
